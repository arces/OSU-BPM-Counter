# OSU-BPM-Counter
Counts how many times you can press Z &amp; X in one second and transfers that into BPM

      <center> <b> How to use </b> </center>

Click Start and press Z &amp; X into the text box as fast as you can.

Every second it will check if your current BPM is higher than your Max BPM

If you want hit End and it will clear the text box and set your current BPM to 0

If you want to clear your Max BPM just high Clear Max BPM and it will go to 0


This is AS IS software and should work perfectly fine. If you want to change the two keys just change the key code numbers in the code
